## About

Beenice is an app to give and receive positive messages from strangers who you can connect with if both parties consent.

## Installation

The whole application is dockerised, therefore you only need to run a few commands that are already prepared for you in the `Makefile`.

**Build the project**:
```bash
make build
```

**Run the project**:
